## SICP
SICP with Scheme ^_^

## Objections

Create the best wiki with problem solutions from classic book SICP. Use old-school Scheme instead of Ruby, Elixir, F#, Haskell, SML, Clojure or any other language.

This repository inspired by Dan Grossman course about programming languages. (Coursera.)

Contribution and discussion are welcomed!

## Notes
Scheme is an applicative-order language, namely, that all the arguments to Scheme procedures are evaluated when the procedure is applied. In contrast, normal-order languages delay evaluation of procedure arguments until the actual argument values are needed.

So applicative-order is strict evaluation and (?)call by value semantic; normal-order is lazy evaluation and call by name semantic. First name is from SICP, second from Haskell, third from Scala course by M. Odersky.
