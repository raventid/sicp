;sqrt-iter will never terminate.
;The first time new-if is called it is passed two arguments, guess and (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x).
;Scheme uses applicative order evaluation and so another call to sqrt-iter will be evaluated resulting in the following behaviour which wonâ€™t terminate:
;sqrt-iter
;  new-if
;    sqrt-iter
;      new-if
;        ...
